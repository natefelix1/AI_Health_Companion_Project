## Disclaimers & Consent Handling

### 1. Minimal Disclaimers
- **Persistent Footer**:
  - Small text near bottom of main screens: "Data-driven insights, not medical advice."
- **Action-Based Overlays**:
  - Appear only when changing sharing/export settings

### 2. Consent Flow
- **Onboarding**:
  - Single screen collecting broad consent
  - Detailed explanation of data usage
- **Periodic Renewals**:
  - Banner or pop-up every 90 days prompting reconfirmation

### 3. No Chatbot Disclaimers
- **Strict Rule**:
  - Chatbot never states disclaimers
  - All disclaimers remain in app UI

### 4. Future Considerations
- **Add disclaimers for advanced medical contexts**:
  - Potential expansions might require more robust disclaimers
- **Legal/Regulatory**:
  - Work with counsel if app is to be used clinically
