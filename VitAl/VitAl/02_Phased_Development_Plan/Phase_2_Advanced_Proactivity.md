## Phase 2: Expanded AI Intelligence, Advanced Proactive Companion, and Enhanced Customization

### Goal
Deepen the AI correlation engine, refine notifications, grow watchOS capabilities, and expand user customization.

---

### 1. Advanced Proactive AI Companion
- **Trend Analysis**:
  - Introduce correlation detection (weather vs. step count, screen time vs. sleep, etc.)
  - AI suggests new dashboard widgets or correlations automatically
- **Notification System**:
  - Smart triggers on iPhone/watchOS (activity drop, high AQI, poor sleep)
  - Examples: “AQI is high; consider an indoor workout”
- **Contextual Understanding**:
  - AI references past user queries and goals

---

### 2. Chat-Driven Customization
- **Conversational Dash Editing**:
  - User can request: “Add a tile comparing my last 7 days of step count to weather data.”
  - AI auto-creates or updates dashboards
- **Ongoing Personalization**:
  - AI adjusts suggestions based on user feedback (frequency, type of notifications, etc.)

---

### 3. watchOS Feature Parity & Expansion
- **Deeper watchOS Integration**:
  - Voice-based chat with AI
  - Quick replies to AI notifications
- **Additional Glances & Complications**:
  - Show more data (sleep status, daily steps vs. baseline, upcoming weather)

---

### 4. Enhanced Data Collection
- **Periodic Analysis**:
  - Scheduled nightly correlation tasks when phone/watch are charging
- **Location/Weather/AQI**:
  - More robust caching logic to minimize repeated API calls

---

### 5. Refined Disclaimers & Consent
- **Triggered Context**:
  - If AI draws near-medical conclusion, show non-chat “insight note” clarifying it’s not a doctor’s diagnosis
- **Minimal UI**:
  - Still no disclaimers from chatbot itself
- **Consent Renewals**:
  - Gentle prompts to reconfirm data usage

---

**End of Phase 2 Deliverable**:
- Stronger AI correlation
- Advanced notifications
- watchOS enhancements
- Chat-driven dashboard personalization
- Streamlined disclaimers/consents
