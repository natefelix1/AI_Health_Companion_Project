## Introduction
Welcome to the AI Health Companion Project! This repository contains all files, specifications, and guidelines necessary to develop a VisionOS-inspired health-tracking and AI-driven companion app for iOS and watchOS. The project integrates Apple Health data, proactive AI insights, specialized agents, and an elegant, user-friendly design.

## Project Vision & Goals
- **Vision**: Combine real-time health data, AI-driven insights, and an elegant VisionOS aesthetic to create a frictionless, proactive health companion that helps users discover meaningful correlations and adopt healthier habits.
- **Goals**:
  1. Offer immediate usability in Phase 1 with robust HealthKit integration and basic AI features.
  2. Continuously expand AI capabilities for advanced trend detection, specialized domains (sleep, stress, etc.), and dynamic user guidance.
  3. Achieve a polished user experience across iPhone and watchOS with minimal disclaimers, in-app consents, and privacy controls.
