## Phase 3: Specialized AI Agents & Advanced Contextual Analytics

### Goal
Introduce modular specialized AI agents and deeper contextual analytics to handle more complex tasks sooner.

---

### 1. Specialized AI Agents
- **Agent Examples**:
  - Sleep Specialist, Activity Coach, Stress/Mental Health Companion
- **Modular Setup**:
  - Separate prompt structures/domains for each specialized agent
  - Agents run on-device for real-time correlation; OpenAI used for complex conversation
- **Agent Switching & Interplay**:
  - Users choose which agent to consult
  - Agents share global user context but focus on relevant data

---

### 2. Advanced Contextual Correlation Engine
- **Deep Data Cross-Referencing**:
  - Merge location, AQI, sleep, HRV, mood logs, etc.
  - Identify multifactor patterns: “You sleep longer on rainy days, especially if screen time < 2 hrs.”
- **Extended Prediction & Alerts**:
  - On-device predictive modeling for negative trends or upcoming issues
- **Semi-Autonomous Dashboard Updates**:
  - AI proposes new modules or removal of ignored ones; user approves or denies

---

### 3. (Deprioritized) External Sharing & PDF Export
- **Basic PDF Export**:
  - Personal record-keeping with minimal customization
- **Granular Privacy Toggles**:
  - For future external provider sharing (low priority in this phase)

---

**End of Phase 3 Deliverable**:
- Multiple specialized AI agents
- Advanced correlation engine
- More personal insights
- Optional data export
