## I. Comprehensive Design & Aesthetic Guide (VisionOS Style)

### 1. Overall Look & Feel
- **Color Palette**  
  - **Primary**: Subtle, low-contrast neutrals (e.g., light gray/soft white for light mode, deep slate/true black for dark mode).  
  - **Accent**: Glass-like translucency with subtle blur effects.  
  - **Highlights**: A saturated color (e.g., teal or royal blue) for important interactive elements.

- **Typography**  
  - Use **San Francisco (SF Pro)** as recommended by Apple’s HIG.  
  - Headers: Semi-bold  
  - Body: Regular weight  
  - Slightly increased line spacing for readability

- **Layout & Components**  
  - Floating card approach for panels and pop-ups, with soft shadows to mimic depth.  
  - Corner radius ~ 12–16pt.  
  - Subtle drop shadows; minimal but present to differentiate layers.

- **Iconography & Imagery**  
  - SF Symbols for system icons related to Health, charts, watch, etc.  
  - Minimal line-based icons for any custom designs, consistent style.

- **Dark Mode**  
  - Sync with system dark mode.  
  - Maintain translucency with a darker alpha level.

- **Animations & Transitions**  
  - Smooth transitions for screen-to-screen navigation.  
  - Subtle fade or spring animations for pop-ups and modals.

- **Dynamic Island Integration**  
  - AI chat “quick-access” button visually anchored near/within the Dynamic Island.  
  - Expands into a small pop-over or bubble for immediate AI text input.

### 2. VisionOS-Inspired Components
- **Glass Pane UI**:  
  - Translucent panels with blurred backgrounds to convey depth.
- **Floating Sheets**:  
  - Sheets and modals appear suspended, with drop shadows and gentle scaling animations.

### 3. Example Use Cases
- **Home Screen**: Card at top for daily summary, translucent background, relevant icons.  
- **Dashboard View**: Floating modules or “widgets” that can be rearranged.  
- **AI Chat**: Expanding bubble from Dynamic Island or bottom-floating card for conversation.
