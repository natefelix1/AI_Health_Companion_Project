## AI Integration & Specialized Agents

### 1. Core AI Companion
- **GPT-3.5/4** via user’s API key
- Local conversation context caching
- Minimal disclaimers (UI-based only)

### 2. Prompt Engineering
- **Contextual Prompts**:
  - Summaries of user’s health data
  - User-defined preferences (sleep focus, steps, stress, etc.)
- **Chaining & Memory**:
  - On-device store of relevant user interactions
  - If data is large, generate condensed summaries

### 3. Specialized Agents
- **Domain-Focused**:
  - Sleep Specialist: analyzes sleep data in detail
  - Fitness Coach: focuses on steps, heart rate, exercise routines
  - Stress/Mental Health Companion: mood logs, HRV
- **Agent Selection**:
  - Switch in chat UI or recommended automatically based on data

### 4. Proactive vs. Reactive Interactions
- **Proactive**:
  - Automatic notifications (spiking HR, poor sleep)
  - AI suggests new metrics to track
- **Reactive**:
  - User asks “How can I improve my sleep based on my data?”

### 5. On-Device Models
- **Basic Correlation**:
  - Swift logic or Core ML for initial detection
- **Cloud-based Fine-tuning**:
  - Offload heavy inference to OpenAI if needed

### 6. Cost & Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced API Calls**:
  - Summaries vs. raw data
- **Background Scheduling**:
  - Group requests during off-peak or when device is charging
